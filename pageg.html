            <p>The Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM; Arabic: المتحف المصرى الكبير al-Matḥaf al-Maṣriyy al-Kabīr), also known as the Giza Museum, is an archaeological museum under construction in Giza, Egypt, about 2 kilometres (1.2 miles) from the Giza pyramid complex. The Museum will host over 100,000 artifacts from ancient Egyptian civilization, including the complete Tutankhamun collection, and many pieces will be displayed for the first time. With 81,000 m2 (872,000 sq ft) of floor space, it will be the world's largest archeological museum. It is being built as part of a new master plan for the Giza Plateau, known as "Giza 2030".</p>

    <br>
    <p>The GEM will also host permanent exhibition galleries, temporary exhibitions, special exhibitions, children museum, and virtual and large format screens with a total floor area of 32,000 m2.<br><br>
    The museum was built by a joint venture of the Belgian BESIX Group and the Egyptian Orascom Construction.<br><br>
    The original estimated completion date was 2013, and past estimates of the opening date have varied. In July 2023, the Minister of Tourism and Antiquities said that he "anticipates" the opening to be between October 2023 and February 2024.</p>

            <p id="sec2G">The building design was decided by an architectural competition announced on 7 January 2002. The organisers received 1,557 entries from 82 countries, making it the second largest architectural competition in history. In the second stage of the competition, 20 entries submitted additional information on their designs. Judging was complete by 2 June 2003. The competition was won by architects Róisín Heneghan and Shi-Fu Peng, and their company Heneghan Peng Architects of Ireland; the awarded prize was US$250,000. The building was designed by Heneghan Peng

                <p>In January 2018, Besix and Orascom brought in and installed an 82-ton, 3,200-year-old statue of Ramses II in the Grand Egyptian Museum. It was the first artefact to be installed in the Museum, during construction, due to its size.

                    In May 2018, the last of King Tutankhamun's chariots was moved to GEM.
                    <br><br>
                    In November 2018, the estimate for a full opening was pushed back to last quarter of 2020, according to Tarek Tawfik, GEM's director. In April 2020, the planned opening of the museum was pushed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Various subsequent estimates ranged from 2020 to 2023.
                    <br><br>
                    In August 2020, two colossal statues discovered in the sunken city of Thonis-Heracleion by the IEASM were set up in the entrance hall of the GEM.
                    <br><br>
                    Although there has been no official announcement of an opening date, in July 2023, the Minister of Tourism and Antiquities said that he "anticipates" the opening to be between October 2023 and February 2024.
